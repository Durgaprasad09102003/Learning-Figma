1. **Day 1: Setting Up**
   - Learn about Figma, its interface, and basic tools.
   - Project: Create a new Figma file and explore the workspace.






Creating a new Figma file and exploring the workspace involves several steps. Here's a guide to help you get started:

### Step 1: Create a New Figma File
1. **Sign in to Figma:**
   - Open [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) in your browser.
   - Sign in with your account. If you don't have an account, create one.

2. **Create a New File:**
   - Click on the `+ New file` button on the home screen.
   - Choose the type of file you want to create. Typically, you'll select `Design file`.

### Step 2: Explore the Figma Workspace
Once you have created a new file, you will be taken to the Figma workspace. Here's an overview of the main components:

1. **Canvas:**
   - This is the main area where you'll create and edit your designs.
   - You can zoom in and out using the mouse scroll wheel or by pressing `Ctrl + +` and `Ctrl + -`.

2. **Toolbar:**
   - Located at the top of the screen, the toolbar contains tools for creating and manipulating objects.
   - Common tools include the `Move Tool (V)`, `Frame Tool (F)`, `Rectangle Tool (R)`, `Text Tool (T)`, and more.

3. **Layers Panel:**
   - Located on the left side of the screen, this panel shows all the layers and objects in your file.
   - You can organize your layers into frames and groups for better management.

4. **Properties Panel:**
   - Found on the right side of the screen, this panel displays the properties of the selected object.
   - You can adjust properties like color, size, position, effects, and more.

5. **Assets Panel:**
   - Also on the left side, this panel contains reusable components, such as icons and design elements, that you can drag and drop into your canvas.
   - You can create your own components or use libraries shared with your team.

6. **Comments Panel:**
   - You can leave comments on specific parts of your design for feedback and collaboration.
   - Click on the `Comment Tool (C)` in the toolbar to start adding comments.

### Step 3: Basic Actions
1. **Create Shapes:**
   - Use the `Rectangle Tool (R)` to draw rectangles, the `Ellipse Tool (O)` for circles, and the `Line Tool (L)` for lines.

2. **Add Text:**
   - Select the `Text Tool (T)` and click on the canvas to type.

3. **Use Frames:**
   - Use the `Frame Tool (F)` to create frames, which act as containers for your design elements.
   - Frames are essential for creating responsive designs and organizing your layouts.

4. **Import Images:**
   - You can drag and drop images directly onto the canvas or use the `Place Image` function from the toolbar.

5. **Create Components:**
   - Select any object or group of objects, right-click, and choose `Create Component`. Components can be reused across your design.

6. **Prototyping:**
   - Switch to the `Prototype` tab in the properties panel to create interactive prototypes.
   - Link frames by dragging connections between them to define interactions.

### Step 4: Collaboration and Sharing
1. **Invite Collaborators:**
   - Click on the `Share` button in the top-right corner to invite others to your file.
   - You can set permissions for each collaborator, such as view or edit access.

2. **Real-time Collaboration:**
   - Figma allows real-time collaboration, so multiple users can work on the same file simultaneously.

3. **Comment and Feedback:**
   - Use the `Comment Tool (C)` to add feedback directly on the design.
   - Mention collaborators using `@` to notify them of specific comments.
